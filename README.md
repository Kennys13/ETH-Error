# ETH-Error
Error Handling Contract
This smart contract demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for error handling in Solidity.

Requirements
Solidity 0.8.0 or higher
Functions
require_test(uint256 a, uint256 b)
This function showcases the require() statement. It takes two unsigned integer parameters a and b and checks if a is greater than b. If the condition is not met, the function reverts the transaction and provides an error message.

assert_test(uint256 a, uint256 b)
This function demonstrates the assert() statement. It takes two unsigned integer parameters a and b and verifies if a is greater than b. If the condition is false, the function triggers an exception and reverts the transaction.

revert_test(uint256 a, uint256 b)
The revertExample function showcases the usage of the revert() statement. It takes two unsigned integer parameters a and b and manually checks if a is greater than b. If the condition is not met, the function explicitly reverts the transaction with a custom error message.

Usage
Install Solidity 0.8.0 or higher.
Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler of your choice.
Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network.
Interact with the contract by calling the available functions and passing the required parameters.
